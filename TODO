Outstanding tasks
-----------------

 - Figure out how to specify DDave starting points (currently hardcoded for level 3) - info on moddingwiki?

 - Monster Bash file detection

 - Work out whether Crystal Caves will accept maps of a different width (and
   then max and min widths)

 - Use try_read in all isInstance calls to avoid exceptions on short files

 - gamemap: Allow more than one tileset to be loaded

 - Implement support for background images behind levels.  Known background
   types are:
     - Single image, centred, stationary (Cosmo)
     - Single image, moving, parallaxed
     - Tiled image, moving, parallaxed (Duke II horiz+vert, Hocus horiz only)
     - Map layer, moving, stationary (Harry)
     - Single colour (Word Rescue)
     - 1-4 tiles, repeated, alternating on opposite rows (Crystal Caves, Secret Agent)
     - Single tile, repeated (Captain Comic)

 - Have a generic "load a tile in a tileset" function for many of the
   imageFromCode() implementations to use.

Game support
------------

Monster Bash:
 - Replace default black background with first tile, but check to see if that tile is drawn in blank spaces
 - Assume blank foreground tile is transparent (but maybe first FG tile is 100% transparent too?)

Cosmo:
 - Implement image mapping and valid tiles for sprites (actors)

Crystal Caves:
 - Vines will go through some tiles, insert a solid block at the top of the vine
   to prevent this.

Duke Nukem II:
 - Add support for Actor tiles

Dangerous Dave:
 - Enemy paths are in the wrong location in later levels

Halloween Harry:
 - Write palette and tile flags
 - Figure out mapping between actor tile codes and sprite images

Monster Bash:
 - Figure out what additional sprites the rest of the creatures require, as per
   http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/Monster_Bash_Level_Format#Sprite_list_.28.sgl.29

Scubaventure:
 - Abstract sprite list in map-bash so there is one list for Monster Bash and
   one for Scubaventure.

Word Rescue:
 - Come up with suitable overlay images for tiles marked as foreground ones, as
   well as tiles marked as animated.
 - Either list each question mark box with a number, and only allow one of each
   in a level, or make them all the same type and write out the numbers when
   saving levels, and only allow seven in a level.

Zone 66:
 - Test code
