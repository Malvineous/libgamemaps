Outstanding tasks
-----------------

 - Figure out how to specify DDave starting points (currently hardcoded for level 3)

 - Hocus Pocus tests

 - Monster Bash file detection

 - Work out whether Crystal Caves will accept maps of a different width (and
   then max and min widths)

 - Use try_read in all isInstance calls to avoid exceptions on short files

 - gamemap: Allow more than one tileset to be loaded

 - Implement support for background images behind levels.  Known background
   types are:
     - Single image, centred, stationary (Cosmo)
     - Single image, moving, parallaxed
     - Tiled image, moving, parallaxed (Duke II horiz+vert, Hocus horiz only)
     - Map layer, moving, stationary (Harry)
     - Single colour (Word Rescue)
     - 1-4 tiles, repeated, alternating on opposite rows (Crystal Caves, Secret Agent)
     - Single tile, repeated (Captain Comic)

Game support
------------

Captain Comic:
 - The default background tile is left in because it often has an image.  This
   should be removed and changed to part of the background image, i.e. set the
   background to be this tile repeated, so empty bits of the level show through
   to this tile.

Cosmo:
 - Implement image mapping and valid tiles for sprites (actors)

Crystal Caves:
 - Vines will go through some tiles, insert a solid block at the top of the vine
   to prevent this.

Duke Nukem II:
 - Add support for Actor tiles

Dangerous Dave:
 - Enemy paths are in the wrong location in later levels

Halloween Harry:
 - Write palette and tile flags
 - Figure out mapping between actor tile codes and sprite images

Monster Bash:
 - Figure out what additional sprites the rest of the creatures require, as per
   http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/Monster_Bash_Level_Format#Sprite_list_.28.sgl.29

Scubaventure:
 - Abstract sprite list in map-bash so there is one list for Monster Bash and
   one for Scubaventure.

Word Rescue:
 - Come up with suitable overlay images for tiles marked as foreground ones, as
   well as tiles marked as animated.
 - Either list each question mark box with a number, and only allow one of each
   in a level, or make them all the same type and write out the numbers when
   saving levels, and only allow seven in a level.
