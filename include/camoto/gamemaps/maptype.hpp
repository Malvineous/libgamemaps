		 * @return A (possibly empty) map associating required supplemental file
		 *   types with their filenames.  For each returned value the file should be
		 *   opened and added to a \ref SuppData map, where it can be passed to
		 *   create() or open().  Note that the filenames returned can have
		 *   relative paths, and may even have an absolute path, if one was passed
